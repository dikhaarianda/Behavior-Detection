# Theft Detection using CNN-LSTM
This project is a web-based system built using the Streamlit framework that detects theft or normal behavior in CCTV recordings. The system employs a deep learning model combining CNN-LSTM algorithms. When theft is detected, it triggers an alarm warning. Currently, the system is limited to detecting theft behavior in recorded surveillance footage.
